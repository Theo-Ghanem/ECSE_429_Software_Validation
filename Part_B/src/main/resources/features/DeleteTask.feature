Feature: Delete a todo
    As a user, I want to be able to delete a todo so that I can clear out unwanted items from my list.

Background:
    Given the API server is running
    And the following todo instances are present in the system:
        | id | title           | doneStatus | description           |
        | 7  | submit report   | false      | project documents     |
        | 8  | organize files  | false      | alphabetical order    |
        | 9  | sweep floor     | false      |                       |

# Normal and Alternate flow
Scenario: Successfully deleting a task
    When a user deletes a todo with the specified id:
        | id | title           | doneStatus | description           |
        # Normal flow
        | 7  | submit report   | false      | project documents     |
        | 8  | organize files  | false      | alphabetical order    |
        # Alternate flow (deleting an initial todo)
        | 2  | archive notes   | false      |                       |
    Then the following todos should no longer be present in the system:
        | id | title           | doneStatus | description           |
        # Normal flow
        | 7  | submit report   | false      | project documents     |
        | 8  | organize files  | false      | alphabetical order    |
        # Alternate flow (deleting an initial todo)
        | 2  | archive notes   | false      |                       |

# Error flow
Scenario Outline: Attempting to delete a non-existing task
    When a user tries to delete a todo with an id that doesnâ€™t exist:
        | id | error                                        |
        | 10 | Could not find any instances with todos/10   |
        | 25 | Could not find any instances with todos/25   |
    Then the following todos should not be found in the system:
        | id | error                                        |
        | 10 | Could not find any instances with todos/10   |
        | 25 | Could not find any instances with todos/25   |
    And the server should raise an error:
        | id | error                                        |
        | 10 | Could not find any instances with todos/10   |
        | 25 | Could not find any instances with todos/25   |
